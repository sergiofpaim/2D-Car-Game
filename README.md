2D-Car game made with C# and Windows Forms.

# About this study exercise
This game was my fourth coding exercise, it was created to help me understand how to decompose real car mechanics into a game.
## Previous stage
I had just created a minesweeper game.

### Challenge 
My father guided me into creating and understanding the creation of a big and organized coding exercise.

### Next Stage
My next step is to recreate this game, but using the Unity engine.

# Limitations
The looping mechanics of the pitch shifter, used to play engine sounds, can be improved.

# Instructions to run
Clone to VisualStudio 2012 with .NET 6.
Build and run.
