# 2D-Car-Game
2D-Car game made with C# and Windows Forms.

Pre-College study #4

# About this study exercise
This game was my fourth coding exercise, it was created to help me understand how to decompose real car mechanics into a game.
## Previous stage
I had just created a minesweeper game.

### Challenge 
My father guided me into creating and understanding the creation of a big and organized coding exercise.

### Next Stage
My next step is to understand how to use the Unity Editor creating a [Banana Eating Frog Game](https://github.com/sergiofpaim/Banana-Eating-Frog-Game), after that I'll recreate this game, but using the Unity engine, see it at the [2D Car Game (Unity)](https://github.com/sergiofpaim/2D-Car-Game-Unity) repository.

# Limitations
The looping mechanics of the pitch shifter, used to play engine sounds, can be improved.

# Instructions to run
Clone to VisualStudio 2012 with .NET 6.
Build and run.
